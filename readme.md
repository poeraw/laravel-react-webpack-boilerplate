## Requirement
- Webpack
- NPM
- Bower ( Optional )

## Quickstart
- Install all dependencies
- Run webpack --watch via commandline
- Your react files is in /frontend folder

## Main Modules
- Laravel 5.6
- React 16.2.0
- React Router 4.2.0
- Redux 3.7.2
- Redux-Axios-Middleware 4.0.0
- Webpack 3.10.0

## Notes
- I'm using Laragon in windows environment, so you need to check for file permissions in Unix environment.
- I'm using bootstrap's scss for custom styling, you can use any other css framework of react components, eg : Reactstrap
- It's always better to update the modules to the latest stable version, but you may need to modify the scripts.
